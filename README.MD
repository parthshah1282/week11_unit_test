Unit testing is a software testing method where individual components or functions of a program are tested independently to ensure they work as expected. It helps developers catch bugs early, simplifies debugging, and ensures that code changes do not break existing functionality. Pythonâ€™s unittest module is commonly used for writing and running unit tests, as it allows developers to create test cases, make assertions, and automate testing processes efficiently.
